It has AMD and regular global.\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\nInclude the library:\r\n```HTML\r\n<script src=\".../path/to/irtc.js\" ></script>\r\n```\r\nIn your HTML:\r\n```HTML\r\n<video id=\"camfeed\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"></video>\r\n<canvas id=\"image\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"></canvas>\r\n```\r\nIn your Javascript:\r\n```Javascript\r\nvar camera = iRTC.create('camera');\r\ncamera.is('#camfeed');\r\nvar canvas = iRTC.create('canvas', camera);\r\ncanvas.is('#image');\r\n```\r\nThat's it!\r\n\r\n### if you prefer AMD with RequireJS\r\nIn your main.js:\r\n```Javascript\r\nrequire.config({\r\n    paths: {\r\n        'irtc': 'path/to/dist/irtc'\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nthen simply require it like so...\r\n```Javascript\r\nrequire(['irtc'], function (iRTC) {\r\n    // Your Code\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNotice you are including the same file... how cool is that? :)\r\n\r\n## Basic API\r\nTo start any module, you'll call ```create()```, and it will return an object.  For example, if you want a camera, call ``` iRTC.create('camera') ```\r\n### Camera\r\nCamera also includes the video element.  \r\n#### Camera.is(selector)\r\nSo, if you have a DOM ```<video id=\"cam\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\"></video>```.\r\nYou just have to call \r\n```Javascript\r\nvar camera = iRTC.create('camera').is(\"#cam\");\r\n``` \r\nto start the camera and see the feed in the video element.\r\n#### Camera.getStream()\r\nOnce you have the getUserMedia, you can get the stream using this method.\r\n\r\n### Canvas\r\nWith canvas, you gain access to the pixel level details neccessary for more advanced image manipulation\r\n#### Canvas.is(selector, connection)\r\nTo specify with camera you want to canvas to connect to, specify the connection like this... \r\n```Javascript\r\n// with a canvas id=\"image\" and a camera iRTC object called 'cam'\r\nvar canvas = iRTC.create('canvas').is('#image', cam);\r\n```\r\n#### Canvas.getImage()\r\nOnce you have the canvas image, you can simply access the image data with this method.","google":"UA-41556362-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
